HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language)

It is the standard markup language used for creating and structuring web pages. HTML is the building block of the web and provides the structure and presentation of content on the internet.

HTML uses a set of markup tags to define the structure and layout of a web page. These tags are enclosed in angle brackets ("<>" and "</>") and are interpreted by web browsers to display the content accordingly. HTML tags are used to define headings, paragraphs, lists, images, links, tables, forms, and other elements on a web page.

Here's a simple example of HTML code that creates a basic web page structure:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My First Web Page</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to My Web Page!</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
  <img src="image.jpg" alt="My Image">
  <a href="https://www.example.com">Click here</a> to visit Example.com.
</body>
</html>


The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document
The <html> element is the root element of an HTML page
The <head> element contains meta information about the HTML page
The <title> element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab)
The <body> element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
The <h1> element defines a large heading
The <p> element defines a paragraph

Element:

The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:

<h1>My First Heading</h1>

Note: Some HTML elements have no content (like the <br> element). These elements are called empty elements. Empty elements do not have an end tag!

HTML Page Structure

Below is a visualization of an HTML page structure:

<html>
	<head>
		<title>Page title</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1>This is a heading</h1>
		<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
		<p>This is another paragraph.</p>
	</body>
</html>

Note: The content inside the <body> section will be displayed in a browser. The content inside the <title> element will be shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab.

Tags

In HTML, tags are the building blocks used to define the structure and elements of a web page. They are enclosed in angle brackets ("<>" and "</>") and provide instructions to web browsers on how to display the content.
